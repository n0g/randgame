randgame
========

a small tool to randomly decide the next player in tabletop games

the idea is that randomly choosing turns makes it harder for alliances in strategy games to carry out attacks against other players.

the order of players in one round is shuffled, with an option that one can't have two consecutive turns.

this might break balance in some games, it was not tested yet in a real game.
